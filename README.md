# guessMyNumber
I am presently reading a book on python programming.  I created a simple game where the program generates a random number and then asks you to guess what that number is.  When you complete the game it tells you how many guess you took and asks if you wish to play again.  Please enjoy.

### Supported Operating Systems:<br/>
* Windows
* Linux
* MacOS

### Requirements:<br/>
* Have python installed [Here](https://www.python.org/) (right for new tab)

### Running the program
1. Open a terminal(linux / Mac) or cmd(windows) prompt
2. Optional - Move it to documents folder
3. Navigate to the folder with the py script
4. Type, "python guessNumberV2.py"
5. Hit "Enter"
6. Enjoy

### issues with the program as I see it
* Hard to read in its present form
* No input validation on, "Do you wish to play again"
* No input validation on "Guesses"
* Entering a string or char will crash the program in guess input
* Resetting the game needs to moved into a method
* Hard to see entry point of the program
* Fuctions declared over the main program (Hard to understand)
* No scoring system
